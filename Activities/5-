Front page of *The Onion*, April 16, 1912

## Overview

In the early hours of April 15, 1912, the "unsinkable" ship *RMS Titanic* sank when it struck an iceberg, killing more than half of the passengers and crew aboard. The `Titanic.csv` dataset contains demographic information for 889 of those passengers as well as a record of whether or not each passenger survived. 

The *Titanic* dataset is the `Hello, World` of data analytics. We'll continue the chain of tradition by practicing some more analysis using it.

The main goal of this activity is to practice the basic workflow one more time:

- Starting Codespaces
- Downloading a dataset and putting it into Codespaces
- Chatting with Claude about the question
- Clarifying the design
- Generating code
- Running the code in Codespaces to produce a plot


## Setup

Open your Codespace.

If you don't have a `1-Generation` directory, start by creating one. In the terminal, type:
```
mkdir 1-Generation
```
Recall that creating a subdirectory for each project or major unit of the course is a good way to keep things organized.

You can the change to working in the directory:
```
cd 1-Generation
```
You should see the terminal prompt change to indicate that you're now working in the directory.

Next, install the required data analytics libraries. You may have already done this for the previous projects. First install Pandas, the Python data analytics framework,
```
pip install pandas
```
**If you get a popup about virtual environments**, choose "Don't show this again" to close it. We don't need to worry about those in this class.  Then install `matplotlib` for plotting:
```
pip install matplotlib
```

## Data

The dataset is posted to Canvas as `Titanic.csv`.
