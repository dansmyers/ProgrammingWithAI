# Practice with Specs-Driven Development

## Overview

Our goal for today is to practice the specs-driven development process we talked about last time. Briefly,

- Chat with the model (in the regular Claude chat) about what you want to build
- Produce a specs document in Markdown format describing the proejct
- Copy that into your workspace
- Ask Claude Code to read the document and produce a phased implementation plan
- Execute the plan
- Test the result
- Make revisions and updates to the spec as necessary

Work through the ideas below. Tell Claude to build each project as a **single front-end web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Ideas

### Minesweeper

Build the classic Minesweeper game as a front-end web page. Think about what controls you should have for things like the size of the board and the density of mines.
