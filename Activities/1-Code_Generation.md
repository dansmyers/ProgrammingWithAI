# Practice Code Generation

## Overview

This activity will let you practice the basic rhythm of prompting an AI to generate some code, then running it in our Codespaces environment.

## BTC to USD

Write a program that can read a number of bitcoins from the user and output the corresponding number of US dollars. Use $94,416.44 per 1 BTC as the conversion rate.

To start, open up a new session in Claude. Try the following prompt:
> Generate a Python program that reads a number of bitcoins from the user and calculates the corresponding number of US dollars. Use $95,416.44 per 1 BTC as the conversion rate.

Claude will consider your request and produce a .py file. Once you have the result, copy it using the button in the upper-right corner of the display window. There may be some things in the code that you don't understand yet. That's okay for now.
