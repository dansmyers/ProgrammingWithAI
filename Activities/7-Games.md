# Games

## Overview

This activity will practice using Claude Code to generate some simple single player games. Think about the following points:

- Practice writing a good prompt. Think about what details you need to specify to get the behavior that you need from the game.

- Practice exiting Claude to test the program, then restarting Claude to make changes. Think about how you can test the behavior of the programs to make sure they're reasonable
