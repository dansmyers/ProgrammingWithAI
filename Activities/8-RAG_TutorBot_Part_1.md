# Retrieval Augmented Generation: TutorBot

## Overview

This will be our third project, but we're going to mostly build it in class.

The goal: create a Retrieval Augmented Generation application that functions as a tutor for a text of your choice. Here, "text" refers to some written artifact that you can use as the basis for your generations.
