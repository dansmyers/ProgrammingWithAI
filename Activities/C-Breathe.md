# Breathe

## Overview

Let's practice using the specs-driven development approach we discussed in class to make a web-based breathwork app.

- The app will run as a single front-end web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- It will have some controls to allow the user to select a breathing pattern and a visual and timer to help count each step

## Build the spec

The first step is to chat about the project with Claude to build a specifications document. Go to the regular Claude chat - I find it better for this step than using the terminal app.
