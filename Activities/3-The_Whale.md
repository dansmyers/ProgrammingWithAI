# Zipf's Law and *The Whale*

## Overview

Zipf’s Law is a result from linguistics that describes the distribution of word frequencies in many texts. It states that the Nth most frequent word occurs about 1/N times as often as the most frequent. That is, the second most frequent word occurs about 1/2 as often as the most frequent word, the third most frequent about 1/3 as often, and so forth. The law is named for George Zipf, who first described it based on empirical observations in the 1930s.

Let’s vibe out a program that can analyze a text — I’m going to use Moby Dick, of course — and make a plot demonstrating if it follows Zipf’s Law.
