*Water Lillies*, Claude Monet (1906)

## Overview

Under the grading system for this course, satisfactory completion of th standard coursework earns a *B*. To earn a higher grade, you may complete the additional challenge projects, as described below. Each one you complete will raise your grade by one fraction of a letter (e.g., B to B+, B+ to A-, etc.)

The goal of the challenge projects is simple: use Claude Code to build **anything you want**, as long as it's substantial and follows the guidelines below.

Each independent project you complete counts as one challenge project. Do a total of three to get full credit for the course.

## Guidelines

- Awesomeness.

- Demo your projects for me in person to receive credit. I may ask questions about your process, design, etc. You'll submit your code and any design documents on Canvas after making the demo.

- The project must display some initiative and agency. You should be able to demonstrate, through documentation or discussion, that your contribution goes beyond typing a simple prompt into Claude. One way to do this is by constructing a detailed spec for the project; another is by showing evidence of iteration and refinement of your idea, perhaps through a log of your prompts.

- No simple terminal-based text games (e.g. tic-tac-toe, hangman, and so forth). These are too easy. If you want to do a game, that's great, but it should involve a web or graphical front-end and require more design than simply prompting Claude to create a zero-to-one prototype that runs.

- Three projects is the max you can get credit for.
